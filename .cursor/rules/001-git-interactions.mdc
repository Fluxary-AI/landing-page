# Git Interactions

## Commit Messages

Always use conventional commits format for every commit:

- `feat: description` - New features
- `fix: description` - Bug fixes
- `docs: description` - Documentation changes
- `style: description` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor: description` - Code refactoring
- `test: description` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore: description` - Maintenance tasks

Keep commit messages concise and clear. Do not make them verbose.

## Branch Naming

Follow these branch naming conventions:

- `feat/some-feature` - Feature branches
- `fix/some-fix` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/some-docs` - Documentation branches
- `refactor/some-refactor` - Refactoring branches
- `test/some-test` - Test-related branches
- `chore/some-chore` - Maintenance branches

## Branch Protections

**Never push directly to protected branches without explicit user approval:**

- `main`
- `dev`
- `prod`
- `deploy/*`

These branches require pull requests and code review. Always create a feature branch and submit a PR instead of pushing directly.
